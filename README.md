<p>Build autonomous AI agents for the Zero-Employee Enterprise (ZEE). Create intelligent, context-aware agents with unprecedented ease and functionality. The Agent SDK supports single model inference calls to multi-agent systems that use tools. The SDK provides primitives that are designed to be easily composable, extendable and flexible for advanced use cases.</p>

## Features 

- LLMs - a unified interface for all LLMs
- Agents - a single model with a system prompt and a set of tools
- Tools - extend the capabilities of agents with external tools
- ZEE Workflows - compose agents to solve complex problems

## Using the SDK (Quick Start)

### 1. Start with a template

> npx create-zee-app 

This will create a new project with a basic setup.

### 2. Modify the agent 

```js
const agent1 = new Agent({
    name: "Agent1",
    model: {
        provider: "OPEN_AI",
        name: "gpt-4o-mini",
    },
    description: "A helpful AI assistant that can engage in conversation.",
});
```

### 3. Modify the ZEE Workflow

```js
const zee = new ZeeWorkflow({
    description: "A workflow of agents that do stuff together",
    output: "Just bunch of stuff",
    agents: { agent1, agent2 },
});
```

### 4. Run the Zee Workflow

```js
(async function main() {
    const result = await zee.run();
    console.log(result);
})();
```
