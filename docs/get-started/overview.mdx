description: Overview of the AI Agent SDK, including its components, features, and how to get started with the Zero-Employee Enterprise (ZEE).
---

The AI Agent SDK is a developer framework for building and running autonomous agents. It provides a set of tools and components for creating, managing, and deploying agents. These agents operate as a swarm, coordinating and collaborating to achieve complex tasks. The **[Zero-Employee Enterprise (ZEE)](/concepts/zee-workflows)** is a new business model where traditional workforces are augmented by these autonomous agents.

The Agent SDK supports single model inference calls to multi-agent systems that use tools. The SDK provides primitives that are designed to be easily composable, extendable and flexible for advanced use cases.

The SDK enables developers to compose simple single-agent systems or entire systems of agents that work together to form the Zero-Employee Enterprise ([ZEE](/concepts/zee-workflows)). [Agents](/concepts/agents) are the building blocks of the ZEE workflow. Each agent is backed by a language model that can be configured to use a variety of [LLMs](/concepts/llms). Agents can additionally use [Tools](/concepts/tools) to perform actions on the ZEE using outside information.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    ...
    tools: { tool1, tool2, tool3 },
});

const zee = new ZeeWorkflow({
    goal: "The goal of this workflow is to...",
    ...
    agents: [agent1, agent2, agent3],
});
```

### Concepts

- [LLMs](/concepts/llms) - a unified interface for all LLMs
- [Agents](/concepts/agents) - a single model with a system prompt and a set of tools
- [Tools](/concepts/tools) - extend the capabilities of agents with external tools
- [ZEE Workflows](/concepts/zee-workflows) - compose agents to solve complex problems
