The AI Agent SDK is a developer framework for building and running autonomous agents. It provides a set of tools and components for creating, managing, and deploying agents. These agents operate as a swarm, coordinating and collaborating to achieve complex tasks. The **Zero-Employee Enterprise (ZEE)** is a new business model where traditional workforces are augmented by these autonomous agents.

The Agent SDK supports single model inference calls to multi-agent systems that use tools. The SDK provides primitives that are designed to be easily composable, extendable and flexible for advanced use cases.

## How the SDK works

    inp1(Input)
    subgraph "Zero-Employee Enterprise"
        router{Router}
        agent1("fa:fa-head-side-gear Agent")
        tool1(Tool)
        agent2(Agent)
        tool2(Tool)
        agent3(Agent)
        tool3(Tool)
        tool4(Tool)
        id1[(State)]
    end

    subgraph "LLMs"
        llm1[[llm:openai]]
        llm2[[llm:groq]]
        llm3[[llm:anthropic]]
    end


    inp1 --> router
    router --> agent1
    router --> agent2
    router --> agent3
    agent1 --> tool1
    agent2 --> tool2
    agent3 --> tool3 --> tool4
    tool4 -.- agent3

```

The SDK enables developers to compose simple single-agent systems or entire systems of agents that work together to form the Zero-Employee Enterprise (ZEE). [Agents](./concepts/agents) are the building blocks of the ZEE. Each agent is backed by a language model that can be configured to use a variety of [LLMs](./concepts/llms). Agents can additionally use [Tools](./concepts/tools) to perform actions on the ZEE using outside information.


```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    ...
    tools: [tool1, tool2, tool3],
});

const zee = new ZeeWorkflow({
    description: "...",
    output: "The goal of this workflow is to...",
    agents: { agent1 },
});
```

### Concepts

- [LLMs](./concepts/llms) - a unified interface for all LLMs
- [Agents](./concepts/agents) - a single model with a system prompt and a set of tools
- [Tools](./concepts/tools) - extend the capabilities of agents with external tools
- [ZEE Workflows](./concepts/zeeworkflows) - compose agents to solve complex problems
