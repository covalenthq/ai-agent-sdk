Agents are the building blocks of Zero-Employee Enterprise. They are the ones that do the work. Agents are stateless and have a single purpose and can optionally use [Tools](/concepts/tools) to help them achieve their goal.

Agents can be called individually or composed together to form a ZEE to iteratively and collaboratively solve complex problems.

## Creating an Agent

The simplest way to create an Agent is to use initialize an Agent with a model, description, instructions and optionally tools.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    model: {
        provider: "openai",
        id: "gpt-4o-mini",
    },
    description: "This agent is responsible for generating reports",
    instructions: [
        "Generate a report on the current state of the company",
        "Use the following tools to help you generate the report",
    ],
});
```

## Adding tools

[Tools](/concepts/tools) are optional and can be added to an Agent to extend its capabilities. Tools are included in the calls to the language model through the [tools](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling) property.

Tools are created using the `Tool` class and can be sent to the agent using the `tools` property during initialization.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    ...
    tools: {
        tool1,
        tool2,
        tool3,
    },
});
```

Read more about [Tools](/concepts/tools) to learn how to create them.

## Running an Agent

Agents can be run standalone or as part of a ZEE workflow. Running an agent standalone is useful for testing and debugging. The `generate` method will run the agent standalone.

```typescript
const result = await agent.generate({
    messages: [userMessage("What is the current state of the company?")],
});
```

Running an agent as part of a ZEE workflow is useful for solving complex problems. Read more about [ZEE](/concepts/zee-workflows) to learn how to run agents in a ZEE workflow.
