Agents are the building blocks of Zero-Employee Enterprise. They are the ones that do the work. Agents are stateless and have a single purpose and can optionally use [Tools](/concepts/tools) to help them achieve their goal.

Agents can be called individually or composed together to form a ZEE to iteratively and collaboratively solve complex problems.

## Creating an Agent

The simplest way to create an Agent is to use initialize an Agent with a model, description, instructions and optionally tools.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    model: {
        provider: "OPEN_AI",
        name: "gpt-4o-mini",
    },
    description: "This agent is responsible for generating reports",
    instructions: ["Generate a report on the current state of the company"],
});
```

## Adding tools

[Tools](/concepts/tools) are optional and can be added to an Agent to extend its capabilities. Tools are included in the calls to the language model through features like OpenAI's [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) or Claude's [tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use).

Tools are created using the `createTool` function and can be sent to the agent using the `tools` property during initialization.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    ...
    tools: [tool1, tool2, tool3],
});
```

## Adding a retrieval function

Agents can be configured with a retrieval function that will be used to retrieve information from the conversation history. This is useful for agents that need to reference previous messages in the conversation.

One of the primary use cases for retrieval functions is to allow agents to reference an ontology of information that the developer wants the agent to have access to. Perhaps a company Wiki for example. This can typically be done by vectorizing the supplied message.

```typescript
const retriever = async (messages: ChatCompletionMessageParam) => {
    // Hit the embedding model to get the query embedding
    const response = await openai.embeddings.create({
        model: "text-embedding-3-large", // Use the latest embedding model
        input: messages
            .filter(({ content }) => !!content)
            .map(({ content }) => content).join("\n"),
    });

    const embedding = response.data[0].embedding;

    // Query the vector database with the query embedding
    const { data: documents } = await supabase
        .rpc('match_documents', {
            query_embedding: embedding,
            match_threshold: 0.8,
            match_count: 10
        });

    return documents.map(({ content }) => ({ content }));
};

const agent = new Agent({
    //...
    retrievers: [retriever],
});
```

The implementation of the retrieval function has been inspired by the [guide by Supbase](https://supabase.com/blog/openai-embeddings-postgres-vector) on getting a vector database up and running. That said, the implementation is entirely up to you to decide.

## Running an Agent

Agents can be run standalone or as part of a ZEE workflow. Running an agent standalone is useful for testing and debugging. The `run` method will return the final state of the agent.

```typescript
const result = await agent.run();
```

Running an agent as part of a ZEE workflow is useful for solving complex problems. Read more about [ZEE](/concepts/zeeworkflows) to learn how to run agents in a ZEE workflow.
