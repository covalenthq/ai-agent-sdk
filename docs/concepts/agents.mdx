Agents are the building blocks of Zero-Employee Enterprise. They are the ones that do the work. Agents are stateless and have a single purpose and can optionally use [Tools](/concepts/tools) to help them achieve their goal.

Agents can be called individually or composed together to form a ZEE to iteratively and collaboratively solve complex problems.

## Creating an Agent

The simplest way to create an Agent is to use initialize an Agent with a model, description, instructions and optionally tools.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    model: {
        provider: "OPEN_AI",
        name: "gpt-4o-mini",
    },
    description: "This agent is responsible for generating reports",
    instructions: ["Generate a report on the current state of the company"],
});
```

## Adding tools

[Tools](/concepts/tools) are optional and can be added to an Agent to extend its capabilities. Tools are included in the calls to the language model through features like OpenAI's [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) or Claude's [tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/tool-use).

Tools are created using the `createTool` function and can be sent to the agent using the `tools` property during initialization.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "Reporting Agent",
    ...
    tools: [tool1, tool2, tool3],
});
```

Read more about [Tools](/concepts/tools) to learn how to create them.

## Running an Agent

Agents can be run standalone or as part of a ZEE workflow. Running an agent standalone is useful for testing and debugging. The `run` method will return the final state of the agent.

```typescript
const result = await agent.run();
```

Running an agent as part of a ZEE workflow is useful for solving complex problems. Read more about [ZEE](/concepts/zeeworkflows) to learn how to run agents in a ZEE workflow.
