The Zero-Employee Enterprise (ZEE) is a new business model where traditional workforces are augmented by autonomous agents. The business logic behind ZEE makes the agents autonomous and able to solve complex problems.

A ZEE workflow contains a couple of components:

- The [Agents](/concepts/agents) that are used to solve the problem.
- A **State** database that stores past messages and results.
- A **Router** that decides which agent to run next.

## Creating a Workflow

To create a workflow, you need to create a new instance of the `ZeeWorkflow` class.

```typescript
const zee = new ZeeWorkflow({
    description: "...",
    output: "The goal of this workflow is to...",
    agents: { agent1, agent2 },
});

const result = await ZeeWorkflow.run(zee);
```
