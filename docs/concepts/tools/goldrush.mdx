## GoldRush Tools

The SDK includes built-in tools for interacting with blockchain data through the GoldRush API. These tools allow agents to fetch token balances, NFT holdings, and transaction history across multiple blockchains.

### Available GoldRush Tools

1. **Token Balances Tool**: Fetch token balances for any wallet address across supported blockchains. This tool provides detailed information including:
    - Token amounts and USD values
    - Token metadata (symbol, decimals, contract address)

```typescript
const tokenBalances = new TokenBalancesTool(apiKey);
```

2. **NFT Holdings Tool**: Fetch NFT holdings for any wallet address with comprehensive metadata:
    - Collection information
    - Token IDs and ownership details
    - Media URLs and metadata
    - Floor prices and estimated values

```typescript
const nftHoldings = new NFTHoldingsTool(apiKey);
```

3. **Transaction History Tool**: Fetch detailed transaction history for any wallet address including:
    - Transaction types (transfers, swaps, mints)
    - Token movements and values
    - Timestamps and block information
    - Gas costs and transaction status

```typescript
const transactionHistory = new TransactionHistoryTool(apiKey);
```

### Using GoldRush Tools

To use GoldRush tools in your agent:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
    name: "blockchain researcher",
    model: {
        provider: "OPEN_AI",
        name: "gpt-4o-mini",
    },
    description: "You are a blockchain researcher analyzing wallet activities.",
    tools: {
        tokenBalances: new TokenBalancesTool(apiKey),
        nftBalances: new NFTBalancesTool(apiKey),
        transactions: new TransactionsTool(apiKey),
    },
});
```

Each GoldRush tool requires an API key which can be set through the `GOLDRUSH_API_KEY` environment variable or passed directly to the tool constructor. Tools can be used independently or combined for comprehensive blockchain analysis.
