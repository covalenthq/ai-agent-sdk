## GoldRush Onchain Data

The SDK includes built-in tools for interacting with blockchain data through the [GoldRush API](https://goldrush.dev/). These tools allow agents to fetch token balances, NFT holdings, and transaction history across 100+ blockchains.

> Each GoldRush tool requires an API key which can be set through the `GOLDRUSH_API_KEY` environment variable. Tools can be used independently or combined for comprehensive blockchain analysis.

### Available GoldRush Tools

1. **Token Balances Tool**: Fetch token balances for any wallet address across supported blockchains. This tool provides detailed information including:
    - Token amounts and USD values
    - Token metadata (symbol, decimals, contract address)

```typescript
const tokenBalances = new TokenBalancesTool("openai");
```

2. **NFT Holdings Tool**: Fetch NFT holdings for any wallet address with comprehensive metadata:
    - Collection information
    - Token IDs and ownership details
    - Media URLs and metadata
    - Floor prices and estimated values

```typescript
const nftHoldings = new NFTHoldingsTool("openai");
```

3. **Transaction History Tool**: Fetch detailed transaction history for any wallet address including:
    - Transaction types (transfers, swaps, mints)
    - Token movements and values
    - Timestamps and block information
    - Gas costs and transaction status

```typescript
const transactionHistory = new TransactionHistoryTool("openai");
```

4. **Historical Token Price Tool**: Fetch historical price data for any token across supported blockchains:
    - Price history over customizable timeframes (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d)
    - Token prices in USD
    - Detailed price data points within the selected timeframe

```typescript
const historicalPrices = new HistoricalTokenPriceTool("openai");
```
